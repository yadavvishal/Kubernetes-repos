# Managing Secrets in Kubernetes

Secret management in Kubernetes is critical for securely storing sensitive data such as API keys, certificates, and passwords. Kubernetes includes a resource named **Secrets** that allows you to manage and distribute sensitive data to your applications.

## Creating a Secret
You can create a Secret using a YAML file or the `kubectl create secret` command. Below is an example YAML definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: xxxxxx
  password: xxxxxxxx
```

Kubernetes will securely store the secret data when applying the above YAML configuration. The data will only be accessible to approved applications or services within the cluster. Note that sensitive values are **base64-encoded**.

## Using Secrets as Environment Variables
This setup is useful for securely injecting credentials into an application without hardcoding them in the YAML file.
Similar to ConfigMaps, Secrets can be used as environment variables in containers. Below is an example YAML definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    env:
    - name: SECRET_USERNAME
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: my-secret
          key: username
    - name: SECRET_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: my-secret
          key: password
```

Once applied, the container within the Pod will have access to the `SECRET_USERNAME` and `SECRET_PASSWORD` environment variables.

## Mounting Secrets as Volumes
Secrets can also be mounted as files in containers. Below is an example YAML definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: secret-volume
      secret:
        secretName: my-secret
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: my-image
      volumeMounts:
        - name: secret-volume
          mountPath: /etc/secret
          readOnly: true
```

Once applied, the secret `my-secret` is mounted as a volume inside the container. The secret contents (keys and values) are represented as files on the mounted volume.

## Updating Secrets
Secrets can be updated using the `kubectl edit secret` command or by updating the YAML definition. Below is an example YAML file for updating a Secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: new_base64_encoded_username
  password: new_base64_encoded_password
```

Replace `my-secret` with the name of the Secret you want to update. Kubernetes will automatically update the existing Secret with the new values.

## Deleting Secrets
To delete a Secret, use the following command:

```sh
kubectl delete secret my-secret
```

Replace `my-secret` with the actual name of the Secret you wish to delete.
