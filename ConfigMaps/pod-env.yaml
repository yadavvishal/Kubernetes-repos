# env: → Defines environment variables for the container.
# name: key1 → Creates an environment variable key1.
# valueFrom: → Gets the value from a ConfigMap.
# configMapKeyRef: → References a key from a ConfigMap.
# name: my-configmap → Refers to the ConfigMap named my-configmap.
# key: key1 → Retrieves the value of the key1 field from my-configmap.


# Key Takeaways
# 1️⃣ This Pod runs an Nginx container.
# 2️⃣ It injects environment variables (key1, key2) from a ConfigMap (my-configmap).
# 3️⃣ If you update the ConfigMap, the running container won't see the changes until restarted.
# 4️⃣ Resource limits are set to 128MB RAM and 0.5 CPU.
# # 5️⃣ The container listens on port 8080.
